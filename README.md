Food & Beverage Marketing Insights Dashboard
This project was developed at ABC Market Research in collaboration with a food & beverage retail vendor. The goal was to support a small business that is still learning about its market and customer base by building a Business Intelligence (BI) solution from their first sample of marketing data.

📌 Scenario
The client, a growing small business, wanted to better understand their market, customer behavior, and marketing effectiveness. They provided their initial dataset and requested a BI tool to answer critical questions.

🎯 Business Questions
The client wanted insights into:
  How are our six most recent marketing campaigns performing?
  How are our products performing?
  Who are our customers?
  What factors are driving campaign performance and influencing buyer decisions?

📊 Dashboards Created
To address these questions, I developed three interactive Power BI dashboards:
  Campaign Performance – evaluates the reach, effectiveness, and ROI of recent marketing campaigns.
  Customer Composition – profiles customer demographics, segments, and behaviors.
  Purchase Drivers – highlights the key factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI – data modeling, visualization, and dashboard development
DAX – measures and calculated fields for advanced insights
Data Modeling (Star Schema) – structured dataset for efficient querying

🚀 Outcome
The final BI tool transforms raw marketing data into actionable insights, empowering the client to:
Measure and compare campaign effectiveness
Understand customer profiles and preferences
Identify the drivers behind purchasing decisions
Make data-driven decisions for future marketing strategies
